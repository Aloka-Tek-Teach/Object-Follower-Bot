# Object-Follower-Bot
Ultrasonic Object Tracking Robot A complete project featuring code, a circuit diagram, and instructions to build a two-wheel robot that uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to detect and follow objects. Powered by Arduino and an L298N motor driver, this beginner-friendly robot stops when no object is detected. Open-source under MIT.
